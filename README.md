# Multi-modal Agent Starter

This repository hosts AI Agents that you can deploy and use on [Steamship](https://steamship.com).

All of the sub-folders contain a fully working project that you can modify and deploy in minutes.

## Instructions

1. **Pick a starter project** among the folders here. Copy and rename that folder so that it becomes your own.
2. **Follow the README.md** instructions inside your new project
